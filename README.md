# Arxiv-tasks
Arxiv (pronounced archive) is a website that hosts a large collection of pre-published research papers. This project aims to access Arxiv metadata on papers from 2017 to 2021 for specific categories.Various task has been performeds using the obtained data.

## Task 1
The goal of this task is to access Arxiv and retrieve metadata (such as title, authors, summary, etc.) for all the papers in the following primary categories:
1. AI
2. ML
3. Computational complexity
4. Hardware architecture
This information is collected for the years 2017 to 2021. The data is stored in a .JSON file.

## Task 2 
In this task, I have created a notebook task2.ipynb, which will contain the code and results of the following steps:

1. Using the data stored from the previous task, create a dataframe for each primary category (ML, AI, computational complexity, Hardware architecture). The various fields of the metadata, such as title, authors, summary, etc., will become columns in the dataframes.
2. Display the first five lines of each primary category's dataframe.

## Task 3 
For this task, I created the notebook task3.ipynb, which will include the code and results of the following steps:

1. For each of the four primary categories considered (ML, AI, computational complexity, Hardware architecture), create a pie chart that shows the percentage of papers falling into the following authorship categories:
   1. Single-author papers
   2. Two author's papers
   3. Three to four authors' papers
   4. More than four authors
(Note: "Two authors" specifically means papers with only two authors.)

## Task 4
Notebook task4.ipynb contains results for the following steps: 

1. Create a bar graph to visualize the number of papers uploaded each year.
2. The X-axis should represent the years.
3. The Y-axis should represent the number of papers.
4. Group the bars by category (ML, AI, computational complexity, Hardware architecture) for a clear comparison.
